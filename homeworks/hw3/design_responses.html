							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that during the design process it is important to 
								identify the purpose of your design and your audience. Instead of 
								starting straight from looking at inspiration photos, having an clear
								idea of the utility of your design would help guide you to what kind
								of deisgn to look for. For example, if your audience are younger people,
								an more playful font might be more attractive than an standard font.
