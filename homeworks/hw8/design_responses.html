						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I didn't know that your would use the term "Dark Patterns"
							to describe how designers can mislead users
							to do things they don't really want to do. I didn't think
							about how an "bad design" is not just designers being
							"lazy" with their work but also the intent of how they
							design the page. On the other hand, a "good design" 
							keeps the user's best interest in mind and are not deceptive. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part of this article 
							is the historical information to "Dark Patterns"
							that goes beyond the web. The picture examples 
							I liked because it gave me a visual reference to how Dark Patterns can be crafted. 
							Reading about the different kinds of Dark Patterns was
							interesting also.   </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

							you have privilege, use it for good."
