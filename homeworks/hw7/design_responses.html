						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the brain's natural function of connecting the dots to create 
								a familair picture relates back to design. I also learned the different
								terminologies of explaining such visual instincts such as "multi-stability" and
								"reification". In UI design, I also learned that the proximity principle is an
								important to factor in because of its tendency that elements that are 
								arranged closer are perceived as more related than those futher apart.  
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article is where it 
								refered to the Gestalt, which states that "The whole is other than the sum of the parts". Relating
								psychology and design methods was something I though was a new
								perspective of looking at things. Also my favorite part was the images.
								The black and white images were helpful in understanding and following along with the agurments
								in the article and helped with visualization.   </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Closure can help us minimise visual noise and convey a message, reinforcing a concept within a pretty small space." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
