						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the speed of the animation has to be 
								slow enough for the viewer to understand what is changing but quick enough
								so they are not waiting. The animation should be longer than 100ms
								for it to be noticable, where 200ms-300ms is considered the best time. 
								The screen size also matters how fast something travels across the screen. Additionally, balancing the energy of
								collision to be evenly distriibuted to avoid the animation to "bounce" was 
								something I didn't know before. 
							 </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed the animations and displays the article included
								within the text. It helped me visualize what they are 
								explaining in words. Especially how the screen sizing and 
								speed of the animation goes hand in hand was nice to see
								displayed. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "For the animation not to look mechanical and artificial, the object should move with some acceleration or deceleration â€” just like all live objects in the physical world". </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
