					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/Wireframe1.jpg"/>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>

						</li>
					</ul>

					<div class="body-header">Responses</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of the website is to provide an simple and easy space where users can interact with it for fun, so it has a very minimalistic design consisting of an blank screen.  
								Its intended for people who have extra time on the internet and want to visit some unqiue websites.
							The website is focused on user interaction, and loads an image of a person pointing at the users cursor on the screen. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> The simplicity of the website may make people confused for what its purpose is, so in my redesigned image,
								I added an title that would lable what this website is called. Then I also added a brief description for what
							the website does and how the user can interact with it. However I still wanted to keep the minimalistic look of 
						the original website, so I didn't add functions that would not add to the playful purpose of the website, such as a search bar. </p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
