        Hi, my name is Anna! I have been dancing for 17 years in various dance styles, 
        from ballet to hip hop, and like to experiment with different sketches of people, design ideas, and do photography. I am mixed race 
        (half Japanese and a quarter Italian and Irish), which I feel is a big part of my identity in how it shapes my personal values. I 
        like learning more about my own culture and enjoy learning about the different cultures I often encounter here at UC Berkeley!

        <h2>Part 2</h2>
        
        <ul>I learned that actively focusing on the design of the app rather 
                than directly looking at the content can reveal the nuances behind design
                choices. Observing the details of the design choices can also inspire design
                choices I may make as well. </ul>

        <ul>My favorite part of the website is the demo of each app, 
            displaying its design features. The animation of the demo helped 
            break design pieces down, which made it engaging for the viewer 
            and easier to see.</ul>

        <ul>"By routinely analyzing other apps, you'll develop your 
            product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself".</ul>
            
        <ul> I give this article a 8/10.</ul>
