                            <p> I learned about the different styles that you can design
                                an website or app platform. The purpose the app or website 
                                is created for involves different functions and design choices. The designs
                                in each inspirations used contrasting colors that made it easily viewable for the user.  </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I enjoyed looking at the various design styles for each inspiration page.
                                The animation choices that each design style had was my
                                favorite part because the app or website was transitioning info
                                creative ways. Some deisgns showed characteristics similar to
                                videogame graphics which I thought was interesting as well.   </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> The Travel Map by Never-stop for Radio Design was my favorite 
                                because I thought the animation choices were unqiue compared to
                                other map platforms I use. For example, the search bar text crumbles away when you start
                                to type something in. Additionally, the purple line animation
                                that appears when showing your route is satisfying. It reminds me of
                                videogame animation where the purple is in a bright florescent color and the 
                                animation style resembles electricity.  </p>
                        </li>

                            <p> I give it an 9/10 because I enjoyed looking at the different possible animation styles each design inspo had and thought they
                                were very creative. </p>
