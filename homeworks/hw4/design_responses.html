							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> According to the article, I didn't know that 
								there is about 217 milion people who live with some 
								form of moderate to severe vision impairment. With physical
								design, I can image how buildings can be designed in 
								certian ways for disabled people to access them. However, because
								vision impairment is harder to picture from the other persons perspective,
								I didn't realize how important it is to address this factor, especially when 
								doing digital design,

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I enjoyed the example images of the designs throughout the article. For example, instead
								of just relying on colors, the use of icons is very important. 
								Demonstrating this importance through comparison images helped me vision this
								example better than if it was explained in words. </p>
